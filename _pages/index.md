My work involves formulating and implementing cutting-edge product features for Microsoft in the area of Machine Learning, specifically, Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition. Till date, I have contributed to products like Bing, Cortana and Microsoft Cognitive Services. The primary focus of my work has been on improving Speech Recognition for Indian languages, which typically do not have a lot of resources.

I completed MS by Research at IIIT Hyderabad, working in the Search & Information Extraction Lab under the guidance of [Prof. Vasudeva Varma](http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vv/Home.html) & [Prof. Manish Gupta](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/gmanish/). 

I interned at Xerox Research Center India in summer 2016 and Flipkart Data Science for a few months in 2014 as well as 2015.

My interests lie in Machine Learning, Language Understanding, Speech, Social Media Analysis etc.

Outside of work, I like watching movies and TV shows to unwind. Once upon a time, as a chind and a teenager, I used to read a lot of fiction, but I have gone out of the habit unfortunately. I have trying to pick it up again. You can have a look at [what I have been reading] (https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48941817-satarupa-guha?shelf=read).


I used to maintain a [personal blog](https://afistfuloflife.wordpress.com) where I penned down some of my random thoughts.
